MfGames Writing is a set of utilities for working with low-overhead text files (e.g., Creole and Markdown), conversion to DocBook 5 as an intermediate format, and then providing conversions and querying against DocBook files to create PDF, EPUB, Mobi, and other word processor formats. The purpose for this is to allow a writer to work with a file format that works well with source control but still allow them to create the formats needed to post online, send to editors, and self-publish their work.

## Legacy Versions

The `v2.0.0-python` branch contains an old implementation of the library written in Python.
